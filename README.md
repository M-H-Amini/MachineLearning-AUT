# MachineLearning-AUT

One of my best courses. The content provided is the following. In each lecture, after the theoretical stuff, a project using real-world datasets was done with the topic of that lecture.

- [x] Lecture 0 : Intro - An introduction to python and what we need from python in this course was presented.
- [x] Lecture 1 : Linear Regression - Project: California Housing prediction was done using tensorflow 2.
- [x] Lecture 2 - Logistic Regression - Project: Heart Disease prediction was done using tensorflow 2.
- [x] Lecture 3 - Generalized Linear Models - GLMs as the generalization of both linear and logistic regression was explained.
- [x] Lecture 4 - SVM - Project: Heart Disease prediction and MNIST Handwritten Digits classification was done.
- [x] Lecture 5 - Bayesian Classification - Project: A spam classifier was implemented.
- [x] Lecture 6 - PCA + K-Means Clustering - Project: Image compression using both PCA and K-Means Clustering was done.
- [x] Lecture 7 - Single-Layer Neural Networks - Single-Layer Perceptrons with an example of logical gates was implemented.
- [x] Lecture 8 - Multi-Layer Neural Networks - Fully-Connected Multi-Layer Neural Networks and backpropagation was explained.
- [ ] Lecture 9 - An introduction to statistical learning
